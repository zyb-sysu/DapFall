# DapFall: Dynamic Amplitude Probability Density Profile based WiFi CSI Sensing for Fall Detection

This is a repository with source code for the paper "DapFall: Dynamic Amplitude Probability Density Profile based WiFi CSI Sensing for Fall Detection" .

Using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) is a novel way of sensing. Such a system can be used in medical institutions for their patients monitoring without privacy violence, as it could be with a vision-based approach. 

The main goal of this thesis was to explore a novel cross-environmental fall detection systems. To this end, a novel data processing method to extract a new feature, namely "Dynamic Amplitude Probability Density" (DAPD) is proposed. It can be reduce the static components in original CSI amplitude effectively.
